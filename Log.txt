Day One

* 1st Star:
Made Day class, Scanner with Day One.txt as file in.  Read one line at a time stored as string.  
Have two loops that iterate through the string at both ends moving inward until the first digit is found for both.
Store both digits in order (L/R) as Strings, concatenate together, cast into integer.
Count up the total calculated integer values for each line.

[thought while writing -- use two pointers in while loop, start and end, move inward]

** 2nd Star:
Created HashMap of String (e.g "five"), Integer (e.g 5) pairs.
Examined string of each line for any key in HashMap, scanning with two pointers outwardly, also scanning for any digits.
Built new string concatenating values of keys scanned and digits scanned.
Finished with same two loops from 1st Star above.

Day Two:

* 1st Star:
Went with an OOP approach.

Tinkering:
Created Log!
Created Day interface w/ compute method.  Implemented in DayOne class.  Created separate Main file for easy compliation.
Moved all code in DayOne into required compute method.
